                        <p>NBA shorts have evolved dramatically over the years - from the tight, high-cut styles of 
                            the '70s to the oversized, baggy silhouettes that defined the 2000s. What players wear on 
                            the court has always reflected more than just comfort or performance; it’s mirrored shifts 
                            in culture, fashion, and identity. This timeline walks you through the decades of on-court 
                            style, exploring how basketball’s changing look has shaped, and been shaped by, the game 
                            and the world around it.</p>

                            Basketball's first game, played on December 21, 1891, featured bearded players in 
                            period-appropriate attire. As the sport spread in the early 1900s, players wore woolen, 
                            knee-length tights similar to football gear. By the 1920s, shorts shortened to a medium 
                            length and gradually transitioned to synthetic fabrics and elastic waistbands.

                                Between the 1940s and the 1960s, basketball shorts went in the opposite direction 
                                of what we saw in the 2000s - they got shorter, tighter, and more form-fitting. 
                                By the peak of that era, inseams were as short as three inches, leaving most of 
                                the leg exposed. The shorts sat high on the waist and were designed purely with 
                                performance in mind. Players needed to move freely and stay cool under the lights, 
                                and no one thought twice about how much leg was showing. Even towering legends like 
                                Wilt Chamberlain wore them with confidence, not because they were trying to make 
                                a fashion statement, but because that was just the standard. Back then, style took a 
                                back seat, it was all about function, speed, and athleticism.

                                The tailend of 1970s saw the arrival of today’s pinhole mesh fabric, with the Bird vs. Johnson rivalry 
                                commanding audiences to the league. Shorts stayed short but got flashier — think bold colors, 
                                high hems, and tighter fits. It was a decade of swagger and style, where fabric technology 
                                met growing star power, setting the stage for the NBA’s fashion evolution.

                                Drafted in 1984, Michael Jordan revolutionized basketball, transforming both himself and 
                                the NBA into global icons. He also reshaped on-court style, popularizing baggy, knee-length 
                                shorts that remain influential decades later. Some say he wore his UNC shorts under his Bulls 
                                uniform, prompting a looser fit; others cite his habit of tugging at his shorts during defense. 
                                His influence spread beyond basketball, sparking a trend toward baggier sports uniforms across 
                                the board in the '90s.

                                Michael Jordan helped start the shift to longer shorts, but it was the Fab Five at 
                                Michigan in the early ’90s who took it to the next level. Jalen Rose, Chris Webber, 
                                Jimmy King, Ray Jackson, and Juwan Howard made baggy shorts iconic, combining Jordan’s 
                                influence with the swagger of hip-hop. Their look - from the long shorts to the black 
                                socks and confident attitude - reflected the culture of the time. Hip-hop was becoming 
                                a dominant force, shaping fashion, language, and identity, and the Fab Five brought 
                                that energy straight to the court.

                                In the 2000s, basketball shorts got a lot longer and looser, usually hitting around the 
                                knees. It was a big shift from the shorter, tighter styles players wore in the ‘80s and ‘90s. 
                                This change was partly driven by the influence of hip-hop and streetwear, which started blending 
                                more with sports culture. Allen Iverson was a big part of that, his style on and off the court 
                                helped make baggy shorts the new standard. By the middle of the decade, just about every player 
                                in the NBA had adopted the look, and it quickly spread to college and high school teams too.

                                Since the 2010s, NBA shorts have found a middle ground — not as long and baggy as the 2000s, but 
                                not nearly as short as the styles from decades past. They've settled into a sort of Goldilocks 
                                zone: a tailored, athletic fit that usually hits around mid-thigh. This modern cut strikes a 
                                balance between function and fashion, offering players the mobility they need while still looking 
                                sleek on the court. Many players now pair their shorts with compression leggings, blending performance 
                                gear with personal style. It’s a look that reflects the era — streamlined, versatile, and influenced 
                                as much by fitness culture and fashion trends as by the game itself.
