                        <p>NBA shorts have evolved dramatically - from the tight cuts of the '70s to the 
                        baggy silhouettes of the 2000s. This timeline takes you through the decades 
                        of the style and culture that shaped the inseams of the game.</p>

                            <p> Basketball's first game, played on December 21, 1891, featured bearded players in 
                            period-appropriate attire. As the sport spread in the early 1900s, players wore woolen, 
                            knee-length tights similar to football gear. By the 1920s, shorts shortened to a medium 
                            length and gradually transitioned to synthetic fabrics and elastic waistbands.

                        <p>Between the 1940s to ‘60s, they shrunk all the way down to a 3-inch inseam. NBA shorts 
                        were tight, high, and left a lot of leg on display. Even towering legends like Wilt 
                        Chamberlain wore them confidently while dominating the court - because back then, it was 
                        all about performance, not fashion.</p>

                        <p>The tailend of 1970s saw the arrival of today’s pinhole mesh fabric, with the Bird vs. Johnson rivalry 
                        commanding audiences to the league. Shorts stayed short but got flashier — think bold colors, 
                        high hems, and tighter fits. It was a decade of swagger and style, where fabric technology 
                        met growing star power, setting the stage for the NBA’s fashion evolution.</p>

                        <p>Drafted in 1984, Michael Jordan revolutionized basketball, transforming both himself and 
                        the NBA into global icons. He also reshaped on-court style, popularizing baggy, knee-length 
                        shorts that remain influential decades later. Some say he wore his UNC shorts under his Bulls 
                        uniform, prompting a looser fit; others cite his habit of tugging at his shorts during defense. 
                        His influence spread beyond basketball, sparking a trend toward baggier sports uniforms across the board in the '90s.</p>

                        <p>MJ’s trend eventually passed to the next generation, hitting its peak in the early ’90s with the Fab Five at Michigan. 
                        Jalen, Chris, Jimmy, Ray, and Juwan made baggy shorts iconic for a new wave of kids—driven by Jordan’s influence and 
                        the rise of hip-hop.</p>

                        <p>In the 2000s, basketball shorts were baggy and knee-length, marking a clear shift from the tighter styles 
                        of previous decades. Allen Iverson was a key figure in this change - his influence on the court helped 
                        popularize the looser, more relaxed fit that defined the era.</p>

                        <p>Since the 2010s, NBA shorts have settled into a Goldilocks zone, no longer overly baggy, nor too short, typically reaching 
                        mid-thigh. This modern fit emphasizes mobility and style, often paired with compression leggings for added performance and flair.</p>
