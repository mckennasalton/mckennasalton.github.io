Project 2 Process

My name is McKenna Salton and I was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I do love cheese as much as any other wisconsinite. I love hamburgers and hot dogs. I love going to the costco food court and getting a hot dog and soda for $1.50, especially as a college student where money is very tight these days.  I enjoy sports a lot, I grew up playing soccer and basketball and really want to work in the sports industry when I graduate. Especially women sports, as I believe the popularity of women's sports is only in the beginning of popularity. I would love to work for a women's national basketball league team, especially the Seattle Storm or new Portland team that has yet to be announced. I love the hype around sports and how at the start of the game you never know how it is going to end.
